## SvelteWatch - A Svelte Web-App to show the latest and greatest movies dynamically.

### Learning SvelteKit and Svelte as it is one of the most lightweight and blazing fast web frameworks(its actually like a compilor lol) in existence. It is also closer to native HTML and Javascript. 2 way data binding has made me understand how bloated web frameworks actually are. More information [here](https://svelte.dev/docs/getting-started).
